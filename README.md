## [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane) service

[fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane) is a [redis](https://redis.io/)-based queueing service that outsmarts everyone else by using containers.

More seriously, though, [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane) allows you to easily implement new workers in the form of containers.

Instead of the tedious, repetitive work of yesteryear where you had to implement a worker in language X or Y, you just spin a new container with all the dependencies you require already previously installed, and instruct [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane) to run a command in that container. Bang! Instant Super-Powered Workers!

## Getting started

Getting [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane) up and running is very simple if you have both [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

We'll use a sample docker compose that gets all our requirements up (ps: this [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file runs [Docker In Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/) and requires privileged mode to run):

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane/master/docker-compose-sample.yml | docker-compose -f - up -d

Starting fastlane...
Creating fastlane_mongo_1       ... done
Creating fastlane_docker-host_1 ... done
Creating fastlane_redis_1       ... done
Creating fastlane_fastlane_1    ... done
fastlane started successfully.
```

After that you can start using [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane-queue/fastlane). For more details on getting started, read the [following page](https://fastlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/).
